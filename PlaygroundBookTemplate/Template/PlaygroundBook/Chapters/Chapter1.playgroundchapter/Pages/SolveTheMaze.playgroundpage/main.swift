 # Wait, where's Scooby?! üê∂
 
 Duke can't wait for WWDC, and he doesn't want to miss any of the awesome sessions and presentations when they happen.
 
 But he's sure that his pet dog, **Scooby** üê∂ could never stay still and would definitely get lost.

 Scooby will sneak outside to explore the neighborhood any chance he gets! To tackle this, luckily, Duke put a tracker on his collar, so he knows the exact location of Scooby at all times.
 
 He wants to make sure that he can get him back at the earliest, so he doesn't miss anything.
 
 So, he built a map of his neighborhood and used **Search Algorithms** to help him find Scooby fast.
 
* Note: **What are Search Algorithms?**
 \
 \
Search algorithms help you find out the location of certion points in a graph and also help you find distances between them! Some common search algorithms are explained below:
 \
 \
**Depth First Search (DFS)** algorithm starts from a node and visits all its neighbors in order. It takes too long to execute.
 \
 \
**Breadth First Search (BFS)** algorithm explores a graph in layers. It will always find the solution if it exists, but it usually takes long.
 \
 \
**Dijkstra** algorithm finds the target based on least distance from source.
 \
 \
**A-star** algorithm is the fastest because it uses "brains" (mathematically, heuristics) to know precisely the distance to the target!
 
Find out which one would find Scooby the fastest!

* Experiment: Tap on the Source and Destination buttons and then select a point on the map to move them around.
\
\
Tap on the DFS, BFS, Dijkstra and A-Star buttons to view different paths!
 
Oh, Scooby's missing again! üò±
 
Now that we've found a path to Scooby, it's time for Duke to run and go get him back!
